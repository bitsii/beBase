elseIf to elif

class default log level to easily enable output per class
  lvl of log
  default class level
  map with override levels
  paramable init
log instance per class, set the level for log() there (no need for lvl)

in methodNotDefined prefer forwardCall_1 to *Args(List)

proxy work with js using js Proxy
  or backward compat - http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony%3Aproxies
  if has forwardCall or anything ending Args with 1 arg
  
named params? (?typed calls only? - order at gen time?) 
  enum like (array by index?, test in langs)
defaults for params? (if undef set - specific purpose)
be able to use fields{} in method signature to avoid double def (assign args to the props)
  
add print at all passes for file/range combos (file and/or file + range)
BUG line comment imeediate nl comments next line
BUG brackets after newline in call (lists.from) breaks
BUG why does something = bool expr; not work?

?continuation + optional ;, nl = ;

---- BUGs ----

default return not picking up when wrong type
return in loop seen as last return incorrectly (what if no loop...)
last call is return not working for all cases - when the last return is inside a conditional, need to check for closing }
something is wrong with classname get (for jv at least) - visiterror had it (adding " " to it, npe)
castTo is wrong in at least some once cases, checkTypes must be wrong somehow
byteiterator is much much slower than just doing getInt on a string by length, something is wrong there
// Bug with initial elseIf
// math with parens inside a method call is broken
// this doesn't work for (Int j = 0;j < dnumargs && j < maxDynArgs;j=j++) {
// numargs - maxDynArgs + 1 !== (numargs - maxDynArgs) + 1
// if undef(self[n]) doesn't seem to work (at least in List)
// this includes negative values for indexes
// test once assign with not combination
string hash for javascript seems to be different than for others
serialization doesn't work for js

---- ----

gratuitous returns
  stop using return type for this and use the call target instead for chains
  actually stop doing returns for this
  (except for untyped and js, which still return self - tho js could skip assign)
  
direct accessors
  like dynamic call for get/set (bemd)
  bind at compile time for typed (just direct access if call not defined)
  no gen accessors

have a method/call class again (reuse forwardcall, put calling logic (method undef) in it) call?
 predef nums for bems
 move/duplicate invoke? (support same code block exactly for both, duplicate)
 move convenience syntax down so forwardcall wins if present (full control)
 have obj methundef first look for actual method with numargs and invoke if so
 invoke with args (dynamic/fwd itself :-) will override/set before call
 
method accessor, gets method type

multi-return multi-assign (array) (list of types in () like args

functional:
loop like thing for anon func def (lambda(), method())
  explicit to start
  find right spot to split out, can stay for most (where walk up?) - becomes call (where def) + anon method
  assignment to def causes method accessor
filter, filterNot, map, etc

distinguish getting a function from doing a accessor (have a call, also have something other for shortcut, maybe ".."

---

func
  also closure, auto-find vars used and convert to in/out args, pass in, return
  and auto-multi-assign on way out (can be backward compat addition to anon mtd)

support something (>>? double,) as a "," equivalent, for map and such
field prefix to any dec makes it a field
  
list reverse sort (func comparator)

serializer easy skip by index #

notion of close or far syn, changes

a way to serialize by field names, ok with missing on deerialize (more version stable)

for callfromoper cases, if there is a "equalsName" method (for any call which was from oper) and arg is same type as caller call that instead
  do for string equals, notEquals, add, addValue, 

for foreach case use iterator(TypeName) for typed types where available  

named map access (proxy obj, map.e.key (also map.key where safe));
also lists by index, list.1, .2, etc

js all in page coding
  gens and evals in context (app is built (with build) syns are present, gen and eval code- new lib each time hit go (counter in name?) old code stays
  
for untyped anys, calls known to object are made as typed calls
  
string cache the hash value??

all in browser option (load for base, etc) (?precomp base? ?base comp?)
  just a big page with local refs
faster dev - node

and or for && ||
.not as a member on bool (as well as method)
    
proper perf test suite
no final test version of cycle for times 
once many noop like new_0
work out changing any names to avoid extra assign for obj new, int new, etc
  no declare too

exception line matching should be a between, not exact match (see which is exact for inclusion)
  sort, search
  
embed ondemand
golang?

bool default type, is a true and a false (only the true is true)

libs
all in mem parse/output for js
use profiler to see where time is spent

=~ for setvalue
a =~ b += c; (=~ actually first/lowest priority)

fixed kw - like local for now, means descendants can't break contract for accessors, new, create, default

finally

mutating size for map, etc, ++= everywhere

go to int and other reuse in code as much as possible
  just look at be code efficiency (base et all)
  look at build efficiency

in browser code to run
  build read from strings not just files
  for js output to string too (no files)
  run in page
  node repl too
and a shell

doc it up

more ex app

need to have nested exceptions (and output the nest on print) - just "linked list" of exceptions with pointers

c++?
___________________

 also, for many calls can avoid the call even if not literals (int add, sub, etc)
 in some cases (no escape (local anys, not called out except to "safe" mtds))
   could do native ints, bools, same with local/final int/bool members
final for static members (?) - readonly for c#
     onceDeced it's ok, not for not once deced (need to distinguish)
get rid of calls to once and many

proxy for dynamic cases too- in case statement + js proxies (can work for typed too based on presnce of a particular call name)

classNameSerializationIterator (same treatment as classNameIterator)

ide service - https://tech.slashdot.org/story/16/10/22/164226/rust-implements-an-ide-protocol-from-red-hats-collaboration-with-microsoft-and-codenvy

safe navigation (null check then call, "?.")
safe equal check (?==) (not null and equals) (check just the called on?)
  
can, createInstance and invoke - switch to structures which don't depend on underlying reflection
cs and jv like js for createInstance, can like invoke
switch can to be like invoke and to have a genned method, this has been thought of elsewhere (do it for all langs)
  
readline find \n and just substring -1 if last is \r
    
make it possible to skip calls and link up assignments betw org and final
tmp any reduction
 direct use of onces, no tmp any assign (will then have mechanism to suppress existence
 of tmp anys, unnecessary assignments/use other variables, alias)
 extend call et all to get the info through ("skip"))
 skip unneeded temp/assigns
 drop tmp anys for simple calls, chain where possible?
 reuse tmps if same type and only used once
  
type inference - "auto"
javascript webworker concurrency, same model for cs/jv
  inbox or queue?

date strings

version interfaces (things which can span lib vers if needed)
(minor only tracked in documentation terms?)

Separate capacity set and len set (support shrink) have put unchecked

  serialization string utf fix (? to from HEX?)
    strings already to/from int at position
    ?int to from hex string, handle sizing (two position)
    ultimately, string to from hex string
    hex the string at the serialization level, not in string (to catch other cases)

dump { } ( ) where unneeded

---- no lang change req / additive ----
for typed anys, if they support forward could allow for calls they don't know about (and start them out "forwardcally") (now they fail)
make js and others same behaviour
add notEmpty to containers
decide on mutating or not len for string et all and do it (thinking do)
encode/decode base 64 to use instead of hex
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Miscellaneous/Base64

log - level for class, config based (optional), time stamp (optional)
see how typescript and dart translate into js
  example programs, compile to js, look at them
  https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/
  (or don't)

clocker iterator, share lock with clocker

for build to be threadsafe,
   nodes and syns needs threadsafe fixes

utf8 in code (anys, classes, methods), encoding for < > ascii
  http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/unicode.html

info for embedders - main needs to run before start, outer thread should hold lock
  on lib

more concurrency
  semaphore
  queue
  worker threads
  futures (promises)
  atomic int ops
 .. means to back to last target (can be explicit or return from a . call)

programattic access to compiler (incl after a base tree is loaded), mostly for
 testing invalid code cases, maybe for other things too

closure? callback? lamda?
callback/event, mtd, concurrency

args to if must be boolean if they are typed

get test testMisc working for js
-js needs to check types on assign Look for formCast/checkTypes, need to rearrange call assign stuff a bit
-check assigns
-js on typed calls check during arg build, untyped calls have a descriptor obj genned which is checked

method alias - for typed, all references replaced with the other name, for dynamic, that name also calls the alias method (just like the real one...), only one instance of method, no double calls

packaging, node.js packaging is great (npm install ...) mavenish

back strings with regular js List type of js integers (unsigned 8bit) for now.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2647867/how-to-determine-if-variable-is-undefined-or-null
More complete stack traces (opera, ie): http://www.eriwen.com/javascript/js-stack-trace/

later(sooner?) support js typed arrays conditionally (should be much faster/better)

end lang-notes:

int 32bit (c int, int32_t), float 32bit (c float), add long 64 (c long long) and double 64 (c double) (after conversion?)

allow signatures to mark arguments as safe - as not incorporated into members, not mutated, not passed along

in practice now, int is 32, long anyies long long is 64
float is 32, double is 64
unicode is max 4 bytes, fits in 32bit int
have unsigned int value, for java, postive part of 64bit (long) - better because does not depend on
signed implementation being something in particular (2s complement) for byte manipulation
shiftLeft, shiftRight, shiftRightLogical

recursive file - dir delete

need more tests for time and interval

map-like get put on obj could use accessors to get/put, index too (using prop iter)

with mutable literals convention is for the mutator to assure safety of references by copying them, assuming that unknown code may depend on the value not changing

support stream parsing along side string parsing for xml, json

support for getting all method and/or member names
-need to have a way to get all methods (iterator?)
have a class which finds all descendents of a particular class and then runs them if they support the desired method (main args params)
-will have to have a way of getting all descendents of a class

a table with lots

have a descendent of Assertions which has a main which runs all methods which begin with (or end with) "t(T)est"

no arg and single arg calls (at least) w/out parens (return...)
anon methods, become instances of system-method and can only be used/referenced via assignment (when genning them,
 have a different prefix for function - and they are not in any vtables, call maps, etc (they're unnamed as such, only referencable
 via variables)

smart, oldfart, ideas http://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2013/07/28/ruins-of-forgotten-empires-apl-languages/

use private to mean a class which is only visible in it's own library
(none of it's interface/syn goes to deploy)

think about how to support binary serialization

multi value return

arbitrary precision arithmetic
btrees, binary search trees

method invocations which are final for object should be handled in a final way for untyped anys as for typed anys

support "and" and "or" along side && and || (just like you can do "not" as .not())
? for handle nulls gracefully (no iter) ?

generics (generic type) (functionality covers interfaces, generics, mixins)

through incorporation
calls on it like dynamic calls, goes to incorporated type
check that calls of generic satisfied by incorporated type at compile time
whether or not a type supports an generic is determined by if it is ever initialized for that generic (constructed for it...)
generic indistinguishable from regular types during calls, etc (source wise, emitted code different for calls), only at declaration and construction is it different
