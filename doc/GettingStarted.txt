You'll need one or both of C# and Java development environments (depending on what all you want to do).  Node/javascript should also selfhost but at this point it's really just for use in the browser/browser environments

For C# you can use mono (on a any platform) or the .net framework on Windows
for mono you need mono and mcs on your command line path
.net/csc need to install .net framework 4.5 and to add the YOURWINDOWSDIR\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319 to path

For java you'll need the Java SDK 8 (openjdk 8 should work, there seem to be versions with javafx, which you need for the ui but not for basic command line apps, self hosting, or web server cases), you need to get java and javac on your command line path

You'll need InfoZip too (zip and unzip)

InfoZip typically seems to be included on mac and linux (should be able to install on any distro if not already there).

for windows you can find them here:

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zip.htm
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/unzip.htm

Be sure to add zip and unzip to your command line path
